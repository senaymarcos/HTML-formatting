        <br>
        <br>
        &#x1f449; In HTML,the &#60;h1&#62; element is a semantic element,which gives the text it wraps around the
        role(or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page"
        <br>
        <br>
        &#9658;<mark>Here is a top level heading</mark>
        <br>
        <br>
        &#x1f449; By default,most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an &#60;h1&#62; with a large font size to
        make it look like a heading (although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).On the other hand,you
        could make any element look like a top level heading.
        <br>
        <br>
        &#9658;<mark>Consider the following</mark>
        <br>
        <br>
        &#8688; This will render it to look like a top level heading,but it has no semantic value, so it not get any
        extra benefits as described above.It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.
        <br>
        <br>
        &#8688; HTML should be coded to represented the data that will be populated and not based on its default
        presentation styling.Presentation(how it should look),is the sole responsibility of CSS.

        <legend><strong> Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:</strong> </legend>
        <ul>
            <li>Search engines will consider its content as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings
                (see <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide">SEO</a>)</li>
            <li>Screen readers can use it as s signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page </li>
            <li>Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs or without
                semantic or namespaced classes</li>
            <li>Suggest to the developer the type of data that will be populated</li>
            <li>Semantic naming mirors proper custom element /component naming</li>
        </ul>
